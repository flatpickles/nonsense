Nonsense-Generator
Matt Nichols
March, 2012

This is a simple script to fetch a webpage and generate a "poetic" composition by randomly assembling words on that page. Variables "source", "lines", and "words" can be specified to allow user control over the target webpage, the number of lines generated, and the approximate words per line.

Nonsense-Generator is designed to be run as a CGI script, and thus the parameters must be passed in via the script's URL, as accessed in a browser. It can be run from the command line, and the default parameters will be used.

The website http://www.mattnichols.net/nonsense/ provides a frontend to this script.
